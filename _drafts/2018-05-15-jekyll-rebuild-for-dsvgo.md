The DSGVO is coming. The internet will stop to exist. At least the internet we
knew here in Germany. All other european countries were able to read the paper
in time to take care of those changes. Germany didn't and now we have to make
sure that no lawyer will sue us for storing cookies on your computer, to track
your clicks on our sites and try to figure out what might be of most interest.

To make sure that I don't have to spent the money I save for my kids' education
in their future, I removed everything that stores anything.
This website/domain does not store any data at all from you. Nor from anybody
else. I used to use etracker to know every week I have 2 visitors and 4 pages
views. For this I had to send cookies to make sure I might remember you if you
would ever return one day. As I don't write something new here, I don't see the
point in doing so any longer anyway.

The webserver running this site had an access log where I stored your ip
addresses. I don't do this anymore. For what?

But to make sure that my static sites are not changed by a man-in-the-middle
attack I renew the ssl certificate every now and then. If you would send some
information/data to my websites it would be encrypted, too. But you don't need
to, because I don't care. And I don't save any of it.
