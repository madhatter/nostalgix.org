The Quest is over. A couple of weeks ago [I wrote about](http://nostalgix.org/wp/2011/10/why-did-you-break-delicious/) how I have been looking for an alternative to [del.icio.us](http://delicious.com)' bookmarking service, because they new guys running it wanted to rebuild it without keeping the old version available as well.

I found one. As already mentioned in the previous post, I have been thinking about giving [pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) a try. I have been afraid to spent money on a service I am not able to test anyhow upfront, but because there did not seem any good alternatives around I hadn't checked already... what are my opportunities?

I signed up for about $10 a few weeks ago as far as I can tell at the moment, pinboard is the best alternative to the not-longer-available service of del.icio.us. (sigh!) If you are looking for a service like delicious used to be (i.e. working), you might want to give pinboard a try, too.²
