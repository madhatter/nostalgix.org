It's been a while since I wrote in my [blog](http://madhatter2theworld.blogspot.com/)... almost four years.



A few days ago I went to [blogger.com](http://blogger.com). I have no idea why, but I also remembered my login data and there it was: [my old blog](http://madhatter2theworld.blogspot.com/) I used to write in. Not too regularly, but almost once per month and sometimes even twice per day.

But then I became a father - twice - and switched the job and moved and married and ... that's it I guess. But fact is, I haven't been crawling the web that much in that time and only coded for the money and not for the fun of it.



Because I did not use the blog anymore and did not find the time to answer comments on that old "[Oracle on an iBook](http://madhatter2theworld.blogspot.com/2005/05/install-oracle-10g-on-mac-os-x-104.html)" article anymore (and I did not own the iBook anymore, too), I removed the blog from my webspace and never thought I might read a word I wrote into it ever again.

I don't want to migrate the data back here and continue. This is a new blog, right now with a basic theme, as there is not too much content at the moment to have it distributed over and over a again in zillons of categories or pages.  And I will write in  english again, too, as I can't imagine writing about tech stuff in german.

The tweets below will be in german. Might not be the best idea, but I don't care.
